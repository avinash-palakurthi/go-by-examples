- A switch statement in Go is a control flow statement that allows you to execute different code blocks based on the value of an expression. It's like a decision tree, where you check a condition and then follow a specific path.

# How it Works:

1. Expression Evaluation: The expression inside the switch is evaluated.
2. Case Matching: The value of the expression is compared to each case value.
3. Code Execution: If a match is found, the code block associated with that case is executed.
4. Default Case: If no match is found, the default case (optional) is executed.

   ...

- Go doesn't have a **break** statement after each case like in some other languages. Once a match is found, the execution jumps out of the switch block.

## _Switch vs. If-Else in Go: A Comparative Analysis_

** While both switch and if-else statements are used to control the flow of execution in Go, they have distinct characteristics and are suitable for different scenarios.**

# _Switch Statement_

**Best for:** Multiple comparisons against a single expression.

## **How it works:**

- Evaluates a single expression.
- Compares the result to each case label.
- Executes the code block associated with the first matching case.
- Optionally, falls through to subsequent cases if fallthrough is used.

# _If-Else Statement_

**Best for:** Complex conditional logic and arbitrary expressions.

**How it works:**
...

1. Evaluates a boolean expression.
2. If the expression is true, executes the code block within the if block.
3. If the expression is false, executes the code block within the else block (if present).
